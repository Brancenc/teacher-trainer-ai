Language Development in Children 7-8 Years What You Should Expect
Language development in children 7-8 years: Children at this age typically have gained most of their grammar knowledge and are using it in conversations.
Full and detailed stories are beginning to be the norm and the way that children at this age interact socially. They are much better at following directions and acquisition of phonological awareness skills is complete.
Mastery of basic reading and writing skills should happen by 3rd grade. This way, instead of "learning" to read and write, they will be "reading and writing" to learn.
