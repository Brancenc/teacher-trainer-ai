Positive Parenting Tips: Middle Childhood (6â8 years old)

Developmental milestones
Middle childhood brings many changes in a child’s life. By this time, children can dress themselves, catch a ball more easily using only their hands, and tie their shoes. Having independence from family becomes more important now.
Events such as starting school bring children this age into regular contact with the larger world. Friendships become more and more important. Physical, social, and mental skills develop quickly at this time. This is a critical time for children to develop confidence in all areas of life, including through friends, schoolwork, and sports.

Emotional/social changes
Children in this age group might
Show more independence from parents and family.
Start to think about the future.
Understand more about their place in the world.
Pay more attention to friendships and teamwork.
Want to be liked and accepted by friends.

Thinking and learning
Children in this age group might
Show rapid development of mental skills.
Learn better ways to describe experiences.
Learn better ways to talk about thoughts and feelings.
Have less focus on one's self and more concern for others.

Building strong connections
Following are some things you, as a parent, can do to help your child during this time:
Talk with your child about school, friends, and things they look forward to in the future.
Talk with your child about respecting others. Encourage them to help people in need.
Do fun things together as a family, such as playing games, reading, and going to events in your community.
Get involved with your child’s school. Meet the teachers and staff and get to understand their learning goals and how you and the school can work together to help your child do well.
Continue reading to your child. As your child learns to read, take turns reading to each other.
Support your child in taking on new challenges. Encourage them to solve problems, such as a disagreement with another child, on their own.
Encourage your child to join school and community groups, such as team sports, or to take advantage of volunteer opportunities.

Fostering responsibility and positive behavior
Show affection for your child. Recognize their accomplishments.
Help your child develop a sense of responsibility—ask them to help with household tasks, such as setting the table.
Help your child learn patience by letting others go first or by finishing a task before going out to play. Encourage them to think about possible consequences before acting.
Make clear rules and stick to them, such as how long your child can watch TV or when they have to go to bed. Be clear about what behavior is okay and what is not okay.
Use discipline to guide and protect your child, rather than punishment to make them feel bad about themselves. Follow up any discussion about what not to do with a discussion of what to do instead.
Praise your child for good behavior. It’s best to focus praise more on what your child does (“you worked hard to figure this out”) than on traits they can’t change (“you are smart”).
Help your child set their own achievable goals—they'll learn to take pride in themselves and rely less on approval or reward from others.
