Language and Education
An 8-year-old child, typically in third grade, will continue to develop more complex language skills.

Their focus and attention span improve.
They will improve pronunciation and learn to follow more commands in a row than they could at age 7.
Reading skills become more sophisticated. Kids are reading more for content than to learn how to do it.
Around this age, they see that some words have more than one meaning. That helps them understand jokes and puns and start verbally expressing a sense of humor.
Children in early school years can show fast growth in mental ability.
By now, children:

Can count backwards
Know the date
Know days of the week and months, in order
Like to collect things
Like reading more
Understand fractions

Development
Most 8-year-old children can completely dress and groom themselves
They’re getting more coordinated physically -- jumping, skipping, chasing
Baby teeth will still be falling out to make room for permanent teeth that are coming in
Kids in this age group generally grow about 2-4 inches and 4 to 7 pounds a year
Children in early school years complain more about tummy aches, leg pains and such. That might be because they’re becoming more aware of their bodies. Still, parents should check these complaints out to make sure there’s no injury or illness.

Social and Emotional
Peer acceptance becomes more important to your child than in the early school years.
They are learning to cooperate and share.
Around age 8, children start to relax about the opposite sex. Boys and girls might mix more easily during playtime. They might become interested in boy-girl stuff without wanting to talk about it.
They like games and competition.
Organized clubs can be attractive to them.
Lying, cheating, and stealing are to be expected somewhat in early school years. Kids are figuring out where they fit and what’s acceptable.
