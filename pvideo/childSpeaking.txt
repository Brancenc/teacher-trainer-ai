The topic of my speech is why blend in when you were born to stand up
I'm goint to ask you the most important question anyone has ever asked you 
in your life so listen carefully. 100 years from now, do you think people will
rememeber you. Well the answer is simple, if you do what everyone else does around 
you and keep trying to blend in chances are you will not be rememered.
However, if you have the courage to follow your heat and follow your dreams then i can 
gurantee you, you will certainly be remembered. You might say well how does a second grader
know this for sure. Well look at the people who changed the world like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, 
or Mark zuckerberg. They all were different from everyone else and they never tried to blend in
A very famous author named robert frost once said two roads to merge to the woods and out
I took the one less traveled and that has made all the difference. In truth we are all born 
to stand out in our own unique way. But unfortunately it is very easy to fit in, just do what
everyone else is doing and get what everyone else gets. So how do you stand out? Standing out
can come in many performs you can give a standout performance or give people ideas and beliefs that
are uncommon. So my message to you is don't try to blend in when you were born to stand out
