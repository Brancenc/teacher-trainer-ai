Typically by age 6 and 7 your child socially and emotioannly will be very introductory
what their friends think of them. They'll be hurt by criticism, have moments of 
low self esteem, and low confidence, and they'll really want to be liked by all and
are eager to please. This is very importatn time for parents to build up their self
esteem, so encourage positive feedback, positive reniforcement. This is why sports
is really a great thing to incorporate into a child's routine because any organized 
team score provides that opportunity for the child to feel successful, to feel belonged,
to feel like they are a part of something and will really help with their self confidence.
Aside from that, at this point in time also your child may be into complaining they have very
strong emotional feelings and they may tend to complain. While it can be annoying, it is important
to support them and be patient with this because it is typical. It is just part of that natural
development. So again you want to be patient with their volatile motions and you also want to be
 supportive by providing them positive feedback and encouragement. It is really important at this age.
