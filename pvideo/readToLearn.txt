learning gets a little more complicated
in second grade
so how do you know they're actually
learning from what they read
it's all about looking for connections
connecting something they know
to something new they just read
there is a computer inside the robot dog
the computer acts like apron
here celeste knows about big computers
already and connects what she knows to
what she's reading and seeing
i think it's probably
not the ones that we used to go on the
internet but it's like a smaller one
like a mini one
or something and right here you can see
the computer inside
this robot dog so um yeah but i think
it's amazing how
they could do all their wires and put
them together and stuff
so how to tell if your child is on track
over the years
second graders will build knowledge from
what they read by connecting something
new they learn
to something they already know
