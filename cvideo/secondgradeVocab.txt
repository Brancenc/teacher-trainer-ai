home lots of hands good lands which word
do you think underground underground

we can squeeze them up here be a little
too
big um let's save those three hard ones
for last how about this the water's

squirting everywhere it's nice and
steady what do you think for this water
what's this a picture of Kelsey flows
everyone agrees it's coming out in a
nice steady stream flowing out thumbs up

thing we do when we're working
hard how are they working
Aran silent silently everyone thumbs up
if you agree good I'll put this picture
best I can beside
it all right now we have four pretty
tricky ones let's do this one
first this um tool here I don't want to
say the word they're they're panels that
collect energy from a certain tool not a
tool certain thing out in
space talk to your neighbor do you think
this one
is Bella solar solar everyone agrees
getting their energy from the Sun has to
do with the sun I think these are called
solar panels you can use them on your
house to get energy um so that you don't
have to use so much
electricity um let's
see all
right
what do you think talk to your neighbor
it's either power energy or
electricity reallyy what are you
thinking power why do you guys think
this one's
power Kade why do you think it's power
because it's being Power by power
because there's wires in the tubes uh
actually these windmills are what make
the power they use the wind and then
they turn the wind into into power power
so actually it's a little backwards
these aren't fans like we use in our
house these are huge fans out on the out
on somebody's land and they collect wind
energy actually and turn it into Power
all right what do you need to make the
picture look like this without this it'd
be a very dark front
porch
Callie um actually think there's a
better
one
Eddie electricity yeah we have to be
able to um use the wires that go to the
lights we need to be able to turn them
on all right the last one then would be
energy why is this picture showing
energy why is that picture showing
energy Keegan cuz they're doing they're
using computers mhm cuz it has power
yeah they need power to use the
computers so they get the power through
electricity which would be our energy
those three words are tricky we're going
to need to do a lot of practicing with
them this week okay they're up here

your time please to make sure that you
