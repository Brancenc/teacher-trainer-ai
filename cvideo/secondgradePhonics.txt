hi everyone i'm chris the word whiz
today i'm going to teach you how to
divide words into syllables
we will look for syllables in words in
order to decode or read those words
remember that a syllable will always
contain a vowel
this is helpful when we are trying to
use syllables to help us figure out a
word
first let's talk about open syllables
these are syllables that end with a
vowel
like
tyger
[Music]
and
pie
let
[Music]
the first syllables in both of those
words are open because they end with a
vowel
open syllables often have long vowel
sounds
[Music]
closed syllables end with a consonant
like
send witch
[Music]
car
pet
the first syllables in both of those
words are closed because they end in a
consonant
closed syllables tend to have short
vowel sounds
let's try another one
we can see that there are two vowels in
this word separated by two consonants
so there are probably two syllables
if i divide the two syllables
pick
and nick
i can see that those are both closed
syllables
and probably have short vowel sounds
pick
nick
we can use this strategy to decode
longer words as well
let's try this one
you can see that this word has three
vowels
each separated by consonants
so it has three closed syllables
bass
and cat
and ball
this means that the vowel sounds are
probably short bass
cat
ball
you can also check to see if you have
divided the word into syllables
correctly using this trick
say the word out loud and place your
hand under your chin as you say it
bass
cat
ball
see my chin hit my hand three times so
this word has three syllables
let me show you one more
try it with me
three
syllables so the next time you come
across a word that seems tricky
stop and look for syllables
see you soon
[Music]
[Music]
hello it is chris the word whiz here
with my super cool knight armor
today we'll learn how to read words with
silent letters
take a look at that word night
do you notice anything strange about it
usually we begin figuring out a word by
looking at the beginning letter
but that doesn't work here
this word breaks the rules
it is a jail word
words like this with a silent letter are
very tricky
let's look at some more rule breakers
here are two more words that begin with
a silent k
knock
[Music]
and knob
we do not pronounce the k at the
beginning of these words
just like we do not pronounce the k
at the beginning of night
these words break the rules so i'll send
them to the word gel too
there are other words that try to trick
you too
check these out
in this word
honest
we do not pronounce the h at the
beginning
in the word ghost
the h is not at the beginning of the
word
but we still do not pronounce the h
sound
now let's look at some silent b words
[Music]
the b
in both of these words is silent
we do not pronounce it
thumb
climb
[Music]
the last silent letter we will look at
today is the silent w
like in answer and rap
again
these words are tricky
they don't follow the rules because we
do not pronounce the w sound in either
word
these are jail words too
[Music]
okay
are you ready to show what you know
about those tricky silent letter words
look at this word
can you guess which letter is silent
[Music]
that's right
the k is silent this is the word
not
here's another one
are you ready
check this word out
can you guess the silent letter
[Music]
you bet
that word has a silent b
it is the word comb
[Music]
one more don't get tricked
can you find the silent letter in this
word
awesome job there is no fooling you
this is the word
right
wow there sure are a lot of tricky
silent letter words
good thing you have me around to throw
these rule breakers into the word jail
don't let them trick you when you are
out there reading
what other words with silent letters can
you think of
let me know in the comments below this
video
see you soon
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
i am chris the word whiz
let's take a look at prefixes today
prefixes are groups of letters in front
of a word
these change the meaning
we will look at four prefixes
[Music]
by
and dis
here's one
review
when we add re to a word it means again
hmm
okay so view means to look at something
if we add re
we would have look at something again
we review words before a spelling test
rebuild
let's look here
so we already know that re means again
what does rebuild mean
yes
build again
very nice
fun
is another prefix it means
not
like in
unhappy
that means
not happy
[Music]
here's another one
untie
a shoe that is untied would be
not tied
let's look at buy now
i know that buy means two
do you think of bicycle
if we look at bicycle
it means there are two cycles or circles
bicycles have two circles for wheels
did you ever hear of bicolor
we know what color means
if we have bi or two in front of it
it would mean
two colors
the last one we will inspect today is
dis
when dis is in front of a word it can
mean not
so if we say he is dishonest we are
saying he is not honest
[Music]
take a look at this
dislike
what does that mean
yes it means to not like something
nice work
you know four prefixes
i bet you will see many of these words
now when you were reading
bye for now
[Music]
hello i am chris the word whiz
we will look at the end of words today
are you ready to look carefully
let's go
suffixes are letters at the end of a
word
these change the meaning
we will look at four suffixes
full
less
lee
and
a bull
here's one
truthful
when we add full to a word it means
full of
just like it sounds
so truthful would be full of truth
if you are a truthful person
you are full of the truth or you tell
the truth often
how about painful
what do you think that would mean
yes
full of pain
ouch
another suffix is less
this means without
so if we had use and added less
it would mean without a use
[Music]
a hammer is useless for this project it
is without use for this
[Music]
let's look at fearless
less means without
so this would mean
without fear
she was fearless when she swam in the
ocean
so she wasn't afraid
we looked at full
and less
our third suffix is lee
this one is a little trickier but i know
you can handle it
lee answers the question how
sometimes it answers the question
how often
you can try this one
she acts friendly
to everyone
what question does it answer
how does she act
you got it
she is friendly
let's look at another word with lee
the class has a weekly music lesson
this answers the question how often
a weekly lesson would happen once a week
we have one more suffix for today
a bull
it means you can do something
it looks like the word able but as a
suffix we say a bull
like in the word washable
a washable sweater would be a sweater
that can be washed
[Music]
hmm
what about lovable
the dog is lovable
what would it mean
yes
you can love the dog
[Music]
nice work
you know four
suffixes i bet you will see many of
these words now when you are reading
bye for now
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
hey friends today i'll tell you what
parts can be found in a word and how
suffixes and prefixes help us build new
words
let's go
we need to build a house for these
little birds or they'll catch a cold
[Music]
build is a verb
if we add the letters e r to it
we'll get the noun builder which means a
person who builds something
in the word builder
build is a base word and er
is a suffix
a suffix is added at the end of a base
word and changes its meaning
[Music]
[Music]
no worries
we'll rebuild the bird house
[Music]
if we add the letters
r e
in front of the base word build we'll
get a new verb
rebuild
which means
to build something again
three is a prefix
it helps to create a word with a new
meaning too
[Music]
the birdhouse will be our protection in
bad weather
the roof will protect my nestlings
against rain
and the walls will protect them against
wind
without this house we felt unprotected
protect is a verb that means to keep
someone or something safe
if we add the suffix
ion
to the base word protect
we'll get the word protection which is a
noun
we can also add the prefix
on
and the suffix ed
to the base word at the same time
and the new word will be
unprotected which means
not kept safe from danger
chris's kindness saved us from the cold
wind and rain
thank you for being so kind chris
[Music]
kind is an adjective
the suffix
ness
helped us turn this base word into the
noun kindness
if we add the prefix
un
to the word kind
we'll get the word
unkind
un means not
that's why unkind describes someone
who's
not kind
i choose to be kind
goodbye
